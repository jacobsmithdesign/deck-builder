    description: `**Selesnya Enchantress Voltron** with a token subtheme.

This deck blends tall, Aura-stacked threats with a steady stream of enchantments that fuel card draw and scaling stats. Tokens serve as flexible carriers for Roles/Auras and help stabilise with lifelink.

> TL;DR: Build enchantment density, keep cards flowing, close with a protected beater or a lifelinking air force.`,

    description: `**Auras + Enchantment Density → Snowballing Value**

- Stack Aura payoffs (*Ethereal Armor*, *Ancestral Mask*) on a resilient body  
- Maintain **enchantment velocity** to keep power and draw flowing  
- Protect the main threat with **hexproof** and **totem armour**`,

    description: `**Parallel pressure** from tokens and selective interaction:

1. **Go-Wide Pegasi** — incremental lifelink damage and Role carriers  
2. **Selective Resets** — *Winds of Rath*, *Austere Command* to preserve your board  
3. **Recursion** — *Retether*, *Mantle of the Ancients*, *Hall of Heliod’s Generosity*`,

    title: "Pacing",
    description: `**Midrange engine** that accelerates into overwhelming board states.

- **Early:** cheap ramp Auras and cost reducers  
- **Mid:** multi-spell turns powered by draw engines and Sanctum Weaver  
- **Late:** pivot to **Voltron two-shots** or **aerial token inevitability**`,

    title: "Core Game Plan",
    description: `- Develop **enchantment count** quickly  
- **Suit up** a protected beater; apply pressure while drawing on hit  
- Use **selective wipes** that spare enchanted creatures  
- Keep a **recursion line** available for rebuilds

**Checklist**
- [x] Early ramp online  
- [ ] Protection held up before committing more Auras  
- [ ] Secondary threat established`,

- **Hexproof bubble** (e.g., *Shalai*)  
- **Totem armour / Indestructible** (*Timely Ward*, Umbra suite)  
- **Bounce-proof / Rebuild** lines (*Angelic Destiny* returns; *Retether*/*Mantle*/*Hall* loops)

|-------------------|---------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Spot exile        | Hold **Timely Ward**      | Keep 1–2 mana open            |
| Token sweepers    | **Winds of Rath**         | Spares enchanted creatures    |
| Graveyard hate    | **Plan B** Voltron line   | Avoid overcommitting to recur |`,
